<h1 align="center">Locha Mesh</h1>

The Locha Mesh is a radio network for off-grid messaging, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
transactions without access to the Internet. We are developing the protocol and the firmware for affordable devices like the *Turpial*,
*Harpia*, or their DIY equivalents. We adhere to open source ethos at every
step and aim to make this tool as decentralized as possible so users can
transmit with freedom.
