<h1 align="center">Locha Mesh</h1>

The Locha Mesh is a radio network for off-grid messaging, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
transactions without access to the Internet. We are developing the protocol and the firmware for affordable devices like the *Turpial*,
*Harpia*, or their DIY equivalents. We adhere to open source ethos at every
step and aim to make this tool as decentralized as possible so users can
transmit with freedom.

## What's in the code?

* The main application that communicates with the Turpial devices (ESP32 &
SimpleLink radio MCUs) can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/locha-mesh-chat).

* Our firmware for the Turpial boards (ESP32) can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/turpial-firmware).

* Our firmware for the radio modules (SimpleLink radio MCUs) can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware). In practice the firmware can
be installed on any platform capable of running
[Contiki-NG](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/wiki), but currently our
focus is on support for the
[SimpleLink platform](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/wiki/Platform-simplelink).

* Routing protocol and code for the mesh network be found in
[radio-firmware](https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware) and in our
[Contiki-NG fork](https://github.com/btcven/contiki-ng) repositories.

* Find Locha Mesh simulator, datasheets, and more on the
[Bitcoin Venezuela organization](https://github.com/btcven).

* Documentation can be found
[here](https://github.com/btcven/locha/tree/master/documents).

## Supported devices
